* Welcome to our OOP Fall 2023 Project for KU.
* It's a simple volunteering app following the theme of the year (Sustainability).

* This project was designed to allow people to volunteer in different activities that help our earth to stay clean, reduce wastes, go for green energy solutions â€¦etc.

* This app allows two types of users namely for the initiators and the others are volunteers.

* The initiators can upload their events/suggested activities on the app along with the required details which are further available to the interested volunteers.

* Each initiative proposed by a user must be approved by a manager who should be able to judge if it is theme related or not. If a certain event makes another user interested and they want to volunteer for it then they can register for that event and will be awarded some sustainability credit
